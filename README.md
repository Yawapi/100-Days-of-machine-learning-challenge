# 100-Days-of-machine-learning-challenge
Siraj Raval has challenged the machine learning/deep learning community to commit to 100 days of machine learning. Challenge accepted!


Day 0. Continuing the deep learning certification track at Coursera. I am on course 1 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning), week 3. Thoughts: I really enjoy Dr. Andrew Ng's lectures; they are thorough, well-organized, and enjoyable. I can't link to course work due to Coursera's honor code, but will add links to my own projects later in this challenge.
