# 100-Days-of-machine-learning-challenge
Siraj Raval has challenged the machine learning/deep learning community to commit to 100 days of machine learning. Challenge accepted!


Day 0. Continuing the deep learning certification track at Coursera. I am on course 1 ("Neural Networks and Deep Learning"), week 3. Thoughts: I really enjoy Dr. Andrew Ng's lectures; they are thorough, well-organized, and enjoyable. I can't link to coursework due to Coursera's honor code, but will add links to my own projects later in this challenge. 

Day 1. Still working on week 3 of the Coursera "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course. Thoughts: I'm getting so much out of Dr. Ng's lectures. He goes through each step of the process, and decomposes the mathematics in such a way that I am developing an intuitive understanding of neural networks.
