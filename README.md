# 100-Days-of-machine-learning-challenge
Siraj Raval has challenged the machine learning/deep learning community to commit to 100 days of machine learning. Challenge accepted!


Day 0. Continuing the deep learning certification track at Coursera. I am on course 1 ("Neural Networks and Deep Learning"), week 3. Thoughts: I really enjoy Dr. Andrew Ng's lectures; they are thorough, well-organized, and enjoyable. I can't link to coursework due to Coursera's honor code, but will add links to my own projects later in this challenge. 

Day 1. Still working on week 3 of the Coursera "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course. Thoughts: I'm getting so much out of Dr. Ng's lectures. He goes through each step of the process, and decomposes the mathematics in such a way that I am developing an intuitive understanding of neural networks. 

Day 2. Today was the Native POP (People of the Plains) festival, and I spent the day visiting with friends and relations instead of working. Thoughts: I made a committment, so although I'm tired I will at least watch one video. Siraj Raval posted a video yesterday about coding an API for machine learning, so I'm going to watch that.

Day 3. Today I am watching Siraj Raval's video over Capsule Networks, which were first proposed by the amazing Geoffrey Hinton. Thoughts: This is of importance to me as I'm currently working mostly with convolutional neural nets.

Day 4. The quiz and programming assignment for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" on Coursera finally opened today, so I'm working on those. Thoughts: I can't share anything, because it would violate the honor code, but I am enjoying the programming assignment.  

Day 5. Summer in the Lakota Homelands is gathering time - for ceremonies, festivals, and visiting. Tomorrow I am feeding 20+ people in my home, so I have little time for work today or tomorrow. Thoughts: I'm browsing through the Twitter feed for #100DaysOfMLCode and wow! So many inspiring posts. I'll retweet some of my favorites for the next two days. 

Day 6. Today I watched Siraj Raval's video over loss functions. Thoughts: This is review for me, but nevertheless I always learn something new from Siraj's videos. I found this one to be cogent, entertaining, and engaging as always.

Day 7. Watched Siraj Raval's Bitcoin Trading Bot video (from week 3 of his Machine Learning Journey playlist). Thoughts: Finance is outside my scope of knowledge, but time-series modeling is something we use a lot in hydrology so I was able to follow along.

Day 8. Still busy with summer obligations, so I've been watching videos. Today was Siraj Raval's Serverless Computing with Google Cloud and AWS Training video. Thoughts: My mind is popping with the possibilities. I'm going to spend more time going over this useful material.

Day 9. Today I read "Connecting the Dots for a Deep Learning App" - a blog post by Janardhan Shetty. Thoughts: I enjoyed this blog post, particularly because I am interested in different ways of using CNNs (relevant to my dissertation).

Day 10. Finishing up week 3 of the first course in the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera ("Neural Networks and Deep Learning"). Thoughts: Truly enjoying this course by Andrew Ng. His explanations are very thorough and I'm learning a lot.

Day 11. Started week 4 of Andrew Ng's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course. Thoughts: I have learned so much from the two courses I've worked through as part of the Deep Learning specialization. Looking forward to working through them all. 

Day 12. Still working on week 4 of Andrew Ng's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course- quiz and programming exercises. Thoughts: Great course - definitely recommend. 

Day 13. Finished Andrew Ng's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course with a grade of 92.8%. Thoughts: I put a lot of effort into this course and it was worth every bit. If you want to dig deep into the math and logic behind the code, this is a great resource.

Day 14. Finished week 5 of Siraj Raval's "Machine Learning" syllabus. Thoughts: I appreciate Siraj's ability to organize and communicate machine learning and deep learning concepts. This syllabus has something for learners at every level.

Day 16. I am working through week 1 of Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization. Thoughts: This is the second course in Coursera's Deep Learning specialization, taught by Dr. Andrew Ng. These are rigorous courses over the math and programming behind deep learning. Highly recommended.
